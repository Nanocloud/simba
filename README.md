# Simba
Simba is an open-source mobile datacenter that could fit in your backpack. It is composed of 3 Intel NUCs, 1 gigabit switch, and a bautiful aluminum case.

Computing components are regular Intel NUC. Case is built to contain a maximum of 3 of them.
We advice to buy flexible ethernet cables so it fits easilly in the case.
Intel gives one small power supply per NUC. However, with some knowledge in electricty it is easy to build a unique power supply to power up the whole datacenter with just one outlet.

The case itself is an aluminum case with 3D printed removable rack where motherboards are set up. Two plexiglass doors allow to access the rear and the front I/O ports.

# CONTRIBUTING

We are aware of some improvements that could be done. Contributions are always welcome !
This repository contains the schematics and CAD files of the current version of Simba but being a hardware component Simba can't accept pull requests that would add features (e.g schematics modification to enlarge the case and add an built-in power supply). However, you are more than welcome to help us writing a clearer documentation or to provide with more CAD file format.

We are also currently working on a V2, please us the Github issue tracker to submit and idea.

Finally, even if Simba will remain the same shape, feel free to upgrade the Intel NUC parts !
